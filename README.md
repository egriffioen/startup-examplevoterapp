# Startup Example - Voting Application

## Design

Have you ever endlessly debated with your friends about where to meet for lunch, or had your team at work bog down about an important decision that needs to be made. The Voting application makes it so a group of people can pull out their phones, clearly see the options, and pick their top three choices. As each user makes their choices the results are automatically tallied and displayed in realtime to all the other group members. Once everyone locks in their choices the group can move forward with confidence that the best option has been selected.
